# Crush Your Competition
## Introduction

In this very simple project, I have tried to make a landing page of Crush Competition.

I focusd to practice some properties of Flex, Z-index, Media queries (to make it responsive)and etc.

I have used only HTML and CSS for this project.

*It has taken 2-3 hrs to finish*
